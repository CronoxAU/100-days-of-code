# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot of the functionality done for the Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts**: Virtually all Javascript work today, starting to get things to a place where I am happy with the functionality and now need to look at the design and interface

### Day 2: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the design side of this today and felt like I was getting close to having it completed. Also did a bit of debugging and testing.

**Thoughts**: Lots of CSS and HTML this time, this is an area I struggle in, both in terms of actuall comming up with a good looking design and then in implimenting the design. That said I feel like my CSS is improving and I am starting to be able to impliment most of my (still very poor) designs fairly accurately.

### Day 3: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed and submitted the Pomodoro Clock project and began laying out my plans for the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: Had some insperation overnight and changed the Pomodoro Clock design to comething I am more happy with. Felt very good in testing it as it genrally worked quite well, fixed a few bugs and added one new function to finish it all off. Very happy with how it turned out even if the design is still not very good.
Started basic initial work on the Tic Tac Toe game, mostly setting up the project and object for tracking the game state. I'm looking very forward to this project as I havn't does anything with this much interactivity yet.
