# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 46: March 15th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson 14 and 15 of Javascript 30.

**Thoughts**: As I have said the last few days these really are great classes and I am learning a lot of Javascript here. I am starting to get an itch for diving back into a project but for now I think I want to keep plugging away at these.

### Day 45: March 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson 12 and 13 on Javascript 30.

**Thoughts**: After taking the weekend off it was nice to get a few lessons doen today. Both turned out to be fairly straight forward but very also very effective and as usual Wes' code was clear and consice.

### Day 43: March 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson 10 and 11 on Javascript 30.

**Thoughts**: Made a bi t of a challange out of both of these. Implimented lesson 10 myself first then watched the video to see Wes do it much more impressivly. For 11 I followed along but tried to work ahead where I could then kept going and added some new feasures to the video player. As usual these were expellent and I feel like I am learning a lot about producing well written, easy to follow code.

### Day 42: March 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed lesson 9 on Javascript30 then started working at my by myself through the challange for lesson 10.

**Thoughts**: Lesson 9 was very good and I'm quite interested in getting into lesson 10 and attempting it myself as Was suggests.

### Day 41: March 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lessons 7 and 8 on Javascript30 plus a little bit of react work.

**Thoughts**: After a few days off for a long weekend away it was tough to get back into things, but i feel good for it.

### Day 40: March 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lessons 6 of Javascript30 and some more introduction to VS Code videos

**Thoughts**: Yet again Javascript30 lesson was great, learning a very nice filtered dropdown style control using just pure HTML/JS/CSS. Really loving this course and getting a lot out of it.

Likewise I feel like I am learning a lot of VS Code, starting to get more used to using a very light editor.

### Day 39: February 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lessons 5 of Javascript30

**Thoughts**: Learning some felxbox today, my first time using this, and I was quite impressed. It's always good to brush up on my CSS which is very lacking.

### Day 38: February 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lessons 3 and 4 of Javascript30

**Thoughts**: This course continues to be excellent, I learnt a lot from the array work.

### Day 37: February 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Javascript30, topped off with a learning a little more VS code.

**Thoughts**: I'm really enjoying Javascript30, the projects seem to be right arounf the level in need them to be, not reteaching coding fundermentals but covering the power of standard JS and CSS very well.

### Day 36: February 25th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the [Javascript30](https://JavaScript30.com) program to try and improve my javascript skills in a fairly guided way. 

**Thoughts**: Reviewing solutions other people were getting for some of my recent projects it became fairly clear that my Javascript knowledge and style was a bit lacking. Javascript 30 looked like a way to try and improve this, by providing a series of projects along with video explanations.

So far this is looking really good, the first leason was very infromative and I have alreasy picked up a number of useful skills.

### Day 35: February 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got vscode set-up with git, github and node.js, tested running my URL shortener locally. Reviewed some other URL shortener projects. Began learning React using the FreeCodeCamp beta system.

**Thoughts**: After moving from project to project recently I changed it up a bit today. I would like to move to developing in VS Code rather than cloud9, this all worked well and I was abe to pull my URL shortener project and get it running locally. 

I also took the chance to review some other users URL shortener projects, this has already given me a few good ideas of things I would like to do differently in the next project.

Lastly I got started on the FreeCodeCamp beta React module.

I'll probably try to fouse on one thing again soon but for not it was a nice chance to be jumping around between different things.

### Day 34: February 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: URL stortener project is now live

**Thoughts**: Started today cleaning things up a bit on my project before setting it live then got an application error at Heroku upon deploying. Ended up spending a decent amount of time learning about the Heroku CLI and npm to get everything up and running. Rather than being frustrated I found it a great learning expirence and now have a much better understanding of the role npm plays. This is exactly learning by actually building and deploying things is so much more valuable than solving small challanges or following along with tutorials.

### Day 33: February 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: URL stortener project is functionally complete

**Thoughts**: Lots more learning today on both callbacks and interacting with mongoDB in general. Very happy with how it is comming along. Now onto cleaning up the code, integrating with mlab and getting the index page up to scratch.

### Day 32: February 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: started work on the URL shortener project for FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: This is the backend project I have been waiting for! This is the first one to make use of MongoDB and seemed to have a bit more going on that the previous two. I had to spend a bit of time working on testing with Mongo and also ran into some syncronisation issues which lead to some work on using callbacks. Both were great learning expirences

I think I am on top of both issues now and looking forward to getting stuck in and testing things out.

### Day 31: February 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: header parser API microservice is complete and submitted

**Thoughts**: This was another nice little project. I'm hopeing the next few projects step things up a bit as I am really liking the node.js work and would like something a bit meater.

### Day 30: February 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: timestamp API server is complete and submitted

**Thoughts**: Really pleased with my progress today, got the timestamp microservice up and running and even got it delpoued to heroku, which I had not used before. Very, very keen to get started on the next project.

### Day 29: February 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: timestamp API server is up and running, processing invalid requests and unixtime requests.

**Thoughts**: It quickly became apparent that this is very simple API project intended to validate everything we learnt over the past few assignments without needing anything dramatically new but i am still really enjoying it. I'm quite pleased to be making some decent progress already and hopefully I will get to look at the string processing tomorrow.

### Day 28: February 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed learnyoumongo challanges and got set-up for the first FreeCodeCamp project timestamp API

**Thoughts**: learnyoumongo proved to be an interesting introduction to No-SQL and MongoDB but ultimatly lacked in depth. I'm looking forward to learning more as I start.

Now it's time to dive into the next project, the timestamp API. Today was mostly just getting things set-up in cloud9 and syncing up with github. I already have a few ideas on what I would like to do here, so hopefully i get some time over the weekend.

### Day 27: February 16th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Complted a few more learnyoumongo challanges and started at Code Wars

**Thoughts**: learnyoumongo has been interesting, I am enjoying getting to play with a No-SQL database but the actual console program leaves a bit to be desired. I am up to challange 8 of 9 and so far we have just covered basic functions (Connecting to the DB, insert, delete, find, update). I would have liked a little more of a challange as well as a bit on the design and structure of databases.

Just getting started on Code Wars, which seems to be the most popular of the coding challange type sites. It's been quite enjoyable so far and the problems have done a fairly good job of simulating real world type problems.

### Day 26: February 14th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished git-it git/githiub introduction course and started working on learnyoumongo for MongoDB

**Thoughts**: git-it ended up being quite helpful. I'm really excited about MongoDB, I have worked a lot with SQL dataabses so I'm really excited to see how a noSQL system works. Only 3, mostly set-up, exercises in at the moment but the next few should be very interesting. Then it's time for my first backen project.

### Day 25: February 13th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished expresswork express.js training and got started in git-it git/githiub introduction

**Thoughts**: Having completed expressworks I'm still not 100% comfortable with express.js. I can see the power of the routing and middleware systems but the abstraction really left me wanting to know more about what was actually going on. Either way it's impressive how simple it is to get a server up and running with very little code.

I'm abouyt half way through git-it which has been a good git introduction. To be honest between this fork and doing my Simon project here I feel like I have a fairly good introductory understanding of what git is about and how it works.

### Day 24: February 12th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished learnyounode node.js introduction, got started on expresswork express.js training.

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed working with node.js, so far the step over to express is proving to be a little tricky. I can see the power here but I'm struggling a bit to see exactly where I am making mistakes. Still three exercises down, 5 more to go so no doubt I will learn some more over the comming days.

### Day 23: February 11th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More introduction to node.js with learnyounode

**Thoughts**: I can tell I'm getting into this because all weekend I have been hanging out to get a little free time so I can jump into the next chllange, or impliment the change I just thought of on the current one. Hopefully I continue having this much fun with the backend work.

### Day 22: February 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Lots more Node.js basics with learnyounode today.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting into this; I had expected the backend course to focus on database work but so far working on asynchronously HTTP/TCP requests with Node.js has been great fun and a big change from normal synchronous/event driven programming.

### Day 21: February 9th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: A bit of a down day today, spent some time helping people in the FreeCodeCamp chat channels and a bit of work getting set-up and started with node.js

**Thoughts**: After a few days working on a good project it's a big change to be back doing smaller/practice items but I am looking very forward to getting stuck into the backend work.

### Day 20: February 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Simon is done!! FreeCodeCamp front end certificate is mine!

**Thoughts**: I had a really great time with this project and very much enjoyed the course as a whole. Looking very forward to trying out the Data Visulisation and Back End ones

### Day 19: February 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Functionality and interface for Simon game is complete

**Thoughts**: Got really stuck into this today, completing the last functionality items and getting everything I want on the UI. Still have some testing and styling to do but I am very happy and proud to have this all in place and working.

### Day 18: February 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: UI and general functionality work on Simon Game

**Thoughts**: General interface and functionality is in place now. Next need to work on the different game modes, win/loss tracking and notifications etc. Then lastly I would like to work on the style of the page a little.

### Day 17: February 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: UI and gameplay for Simon Game

**Thoughts**: After a week working on littler challanges I finally got back to my Simon game, focusing on the UI and gameplay. The UI is mostly in place now which just a bit of menu functionality to go. Only the very basics of the gameplay are in place. I will be looking to get the UI completed next then focus on the gameplay and testing/debugging.

### Day 16: February 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: CodinGame

**Thoughts**: Again had some fun with the challenges getting really tough and interesting now.

### Day 15: February 2nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: more CodinGame

**Thoughts**: I have now moved into some of the meduim challanges and am hopelessly addicted. I'm coding these games whenever I have a spare few minutes and thinking about them all the time. I particually enjoyed the second level of the landing the mars rover challange.

[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com)

### Day 14: February 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More CodinGame challenges, on to the medium level now.

**Thoughts**: Still having a really great time with these, nice involved challenges but not too complex.

### Day 13: January 31th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got through a few more CodinGame challenges

**Thoughts**: As mentioned yesterday these are starting to ramp up nicely and get quite challenging while still being small enough to attack in small sessions throughout the day.

### Day 12: January 30th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 more challanges at CodinGame

**Thoughts**: This started off as a little bit of a diversion from larger projects but as quickly turned into a decent, interesting challenge in it's own right. I would like to spend some time on the simon project soon but this is a great way to get some meaningful practice done with numerious fairly small time commitments (rathert then really needing to sit with a bigger project for at least a few hours).

### Day 11: January 29th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More CodingGame and got the basic structure for my Simon game working.

**Thoughts**: Very happy to get some progress on the Simon game. I am mostly following along with some tutorials but it's been a great project so far and I am picking up a lot about javascript objects.

### Day 10: January 28th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More playing around with CodingGame. Also made a little bit of progress on the Simon game, getting the flashing system working.

**Thoughts**: [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) continues to be good fun. The UI is not the best in the world but the games are enjoyable and the ability to select from so many different languags should make this a toll I go back to when learning something new.

Progress on somin was slow, hopefully I will do better tomorrow.

### Day 9: January 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got my Simon project up on github and worked on accessing github projects through Vusual Studio and VS code. Discovered www.codingame.com and has a good time playing around with that.

**Thoughts**: Getting Git set-up was suprisingly frustrating but I think it is working as needed now. [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com) came along at exactly the right time to provide a nice distraction and some good fun.

### Day 8: January 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Unsuprisingly the Simon game proved to be a big step up for me. I have now found a few resources to work with and think I have my head around the logic of what I need to impliment

**Thoughts**: This was vert much a wheel spinning day for me, although not in a bad way. I initially didn't think I would have any time to cond and I neded up getting stuck right in. 

With the size of this project I am looking to move away from codepen for the development process. Given this, and the fact that this is all for learning I am leaning towards setting this up as a github project and learning the basics of this system. 

### Day 7: January 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Sumbitted Tic Tac Toe. Started looking into the Simon Game.

**Thoughts**: TTT was a very fun project. I'm faitly happy with how it turned out. In the future I would like to spend a bit of time adjusting the AI and making a nicer looking game board but I am keen to keep the forward progress at the moment and not get too bogged down.

Started the very basics of the Simon game, I can already tell that this one is really going to push me. My plan here is to get all the funcaionality in place then work on the UI whcih is the oppoosite to the way I worked on TTT but I think will work better.

### Day 6: January 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got Tic Tac Toe AI system running. Spent some time in the FreeCodeCamp Glitter helping people out with debugging and questions.

**Thoughts**: I learnt a lot geting the AI for Tic Tac Toe going mainly with objects, arrays and refrences in Javascript. Just have to tweak the weighting now and make a few UI changes. 

The time spent in Glitter reviewing others code is invaluable, I feel like I learn as much as the people I help out.

### Day 5: January 21nd and 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tic Tac Toe is vitually fully functional, now it's time for the AI.

**Thoughts**: Counting two days as one here as I didn't get much done on Saturday, although I did get a good amoutn of work done on sunday. Very happy with how this is working and already thinking about the AI.

### Day 4: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on getting the basic interface and logig in place for the tic tac toe game

**Thoughts**: I'm very happy with this one. I didn't expect to get much done today but as so often happens once I got started it was very hard to stop. The tic tac toe game is now playable in the most basic sense, next steps will be adding the AI and working on the UI.

### Day 3: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed and submitted the Pomodoro Clock project and began laying out my plans for the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: Had some insperation overnight and changed the Pomodoro Clock design to comething I am more happy with. Felt very good in testing it as it genrally worked quite well, fixed a few bugs and added one new function to finish it all off. Very happy with how it turned out even if the design is still not very good.

Started basic initial work on the Tic Tac Toe game, mostly setting up the project and object for tracking the game state. I'm looking very forward to this project as I havn't does anything with this much interactivity yet.

### Day 2: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the design side of this today and felt like I was getting close to having it completed. Also did a bit of debugging and testing.

**Thoughts**: Lots of CSS and HTML this time, this is an area I struggle in, both in terms of actuall comming up with a good looking design and then in implimenting the design. That said I feel like my CSS is improving and I am starting to be able to impliment most of my (still very poor) designs fairly accurately.

### Day 1: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot of the functionality done for the Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts**: Virtually all Javascript work today, starting to get things to a place where I am happy with the functionality and now need to look at the design and interface
