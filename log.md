# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot of the functionality done for the Pomodoro Clock.

**Thoughts**: Virtually all Javascript work today, starting to get things to a place where I am happy with the functionality and now need to look at the design and interface

### Day 2: January 18th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Focused on the design side of this today and felt like I was getting close to having it completed. Also did a bit of debugging and testing.

**Thoughts**: Lots of CSS and HTML this time, this is an area I struggle in, both in terms of actuall comming up with a good looking design and then in implimenting the design. That said I feel like my CSS is improving and I am starting to be able to impliment most of my (still very poor) designs fairly accurately.

### Day 3: January 19th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed and submitted the Pomodoro Clock project and began laying out my plans for the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: Had some insperation overnight and changed the Pomodoro Clock design to comething I am more happy with. Felt very good in testing it as it genrally worked quite well, fixed a few bugs and added one new function to finish it all off. Very happy with how it turned out even if the design is still not very good.

Started basic initial work on the Tic Tac Toe game, mostly setting up the project and object for tracking the game state. I'm looking very forward to this project as I havn't does anything with this much interactivity yet.

### Day 4: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on getting the basic interface and logig in place for the tic tac toe game

**Thoughts**: I'm very happy with this one. I didn't expect to get much done today but as so often happens once I got started it was very hard to stop. The tic tac toe game is now playable in the most basic sense, next steps will be adding the AI and working on the UI.

### Day 5: January 21nd and 22nd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tic Tac Toe is vitually fully functional, now it's time for the AI.

**Thoughts**: Counting two days as one here as I didn't get much done on Saturday, although I did get a good amoutn of work done on sunday. Very happy with how this is working and already thinking about the AI.

### Day 6: January 23rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got Tic Tac Toe AI system running. Spent some time in the FreeCodeCamp Glitter helping people out with debugging and questions.

**Thoughts**: I learnt a lot geting the AI for Tic Tac Toe going mainly with objects, arrays and refrences in Javascript. Just have to tweak the weighting now and make a few UI changes. 

The time spent in Glitter reviewing others code is invaluable, I feel like I learn as much as the people I help out.
